*WARNING*: This repository contains in =MESA_results/= output of
simulations with file sizes exceeding 100Mb and managed with =git lfs=.
These are also backed on [[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11375523][zenodo]].

** Main take home point

If you need progenitors to study multi-D neutrino hydrodynamics of
stellar explosions, whether including rotation or not, do not waste
your precious CPUh/GPUh on progenitors computed with =approx= nuclear
reaction networks.

These are great for many things, but not to calculate the weak
reactions that determine the fraction of free electrons in the core.
They introduce a *known* systematic uncertainty comparable to unknown in
many other physical ingredients, and thus muddy the waters and prevent
learning robust conclusion from the explosion of progenitors computed
with these.

** TODO list

 - [ ] check resolution tests more thoroughly
 - [ ] upload final results on zendodo [[doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11375523]]
