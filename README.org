** Main take home point

If you need progenitors to study multi-dimensional neutrino
magneto-hydrodynamics of stellar explosions, whether including
rotation or not, do not waste your precious CPUh/GPUh on progenitors
computed with =approx= nuclear reaction networks.

These are great for many things, but not to calculate the weak
reactions that determine the fraction of free electrons in the core.
They introduce a *known* systematic uncertainty comparable to unknown in
many other physical ingredients, and thus muddy the waters and prevent
learning robust conclusion from the explosion of progenitors computed
with these.
